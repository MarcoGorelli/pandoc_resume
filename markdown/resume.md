Open source (pandas)
--------------------

* [Volunteer maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/pandas-dev/people) since Jan 2020, have reviewed 98 pull requests and had 41 pull requests merged

* Hosted pandas sprint at [PyData Festival Amsterdam](https://amsterdam.pydata.org/), where I mentored 15 attendees (many of whom were first-time-contributors) while they submitted 20+ pull requests

* Added new method [`DataFrame.to_markdown`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/30350) (which was featured in the [v1.0.0 release notes](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/v1.0.0.html)), fixed bugs, enchanced documentation, refactored old code, and clarified error reporting

Experience
----------

**Data Scientist at Samsung R&D Institute UK**; Nov18 - now

* Mentored fellow employees by co-organising internal machine learning reading group: presented on SHAP values, markov chains, and bayesian methods

* Upskilled teammates by delivering internal workshop in `pre-commit` and on how it leads to more productive code reviews;

* Improved accuracy/interpretability of hierarchical forecasting models and maintainability of source code (_Prophet_, _statsmodels_, _Jupyter Lab_, _CircleCI_, _pre-commit_, _Google Cloud Storage_, _wily_, _SHAP_)

* Deployed end-to-end web-scraping dashboard, including tests, automated documentation, static type-checking (_Google Cloud Platform_, _streamlit_, _scrapy_, _ScrapingHub_, _pymongo_)

* Deployed end-to-end anomaly detection module for sensor data (_pytest_, _sphinx_, _MongoDB_, _mongomock_, _PySpark_, _AWS EMR+S3_, _Docker_, _mypy_)

* Debugged Python and C++ code, allowing for Python ML model to be reliably deployed to wearable (_Tizen Studio_, _opencv_, _scikit-learn_, _pandas_)

* Passed internal "Advanced Software Engineering Test (C++)" (£500 reward)
