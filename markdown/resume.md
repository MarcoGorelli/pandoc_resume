Experience
----------

**Data Scientist at Samsung R&D Institute UK**; Nov18 - now

* Improved accuracy/interpretability of hierarchical forecasting models by 5 percentage points using simpler models and more careful feature engineering

* Deployed end-to-end web-scraping dashboard and anomaly detection module for sensor data to web apps - included work on AWS, Google Cloud, CircleCI, MongoDB, PySpark

* Mentoring: gave workshops to follow employees on:

  * easier code review via pre-commit
  * test-driven development
  * Bayesian methods
  * Markov chains for denoising images
  * SHAP values for ML model interpretability

**Data Scientist at Sedex**; Jun18 - Nov18

* Migrated dashboards from Jaspersoft to Tableau

**Data Scientist at Sensium**; Jan18 - May18

* Rewrote internal MATLAB visualisation tool in Python, "exceeding expecations"

**Maths tutor at Oxford Exclusif Tutorial Agency**; Oct18 - Jan18

**(internship) Risk Analyst at General Electric Capital International**; Jun13 - Jun14
