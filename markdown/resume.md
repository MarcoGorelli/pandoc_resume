Experience
----------

**Data Scientist at Samsung R&D Institute UK**; Nov18 - now

* Mentored fellow employees by co-organising internal machine learning reading group: presented on SHAP values, markov chains, and bayesian methods.

* Upskilled teammates by delivering internal workshop in `pre-commit` and on how it leads to more productive code reviews;

* Improved accuracy/interpretability of hierarchical forecasting models by 5 percentage points

* Deployed end-to-end web-scraping dashboard

* Deployed end-to-end anomaly detection module for sensor data

* Debugged Python and C++ code, allowing for Python ML model to be reliably deployed to wearable
